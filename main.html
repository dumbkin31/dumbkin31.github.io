            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="content">
            <p>Hi, I'm Ananya! I'm currently studying Computer Science and 
                Computational Linguistics at IIIT Hyderabad, exploring how 
                languages and technology intersect in fascinating ways. 
                I genuinely enjoy coding, especially using Python and C, and 
                I'm constantly intrigued by how computers can solve everyday 
                problems. When I'm not studying or working on projects, you'll 
                usually find me immersed in creative writing—mostly poetry and 
                short stories—or experimenting with arts and crafts like sketching, 
                origami, crocheting, and sculpture. I'm always up for 
                learning something new and love collaborating with others on 
                interesting ideas!
            </p>

            <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I completed my schooling at Amity International School, Noida, 
                    where I studied from 2017 to 2022 and secured 98.2% in my 10th 
                    board exams. Afterward, I attended Kothari International School, 
                    Noida, from 2022 to 2024 for my senior secondary education, 
                    achieving 97% in the Science stream (Physics, Chemistry, 
                    Mathematics, Computer Science, and English). At Kothari 
                    International, I was honored as the School-level Science Topper. 
                    Currently, I'm pursuing a dual degree (B.Tech in Computer Science 
                    and MS by Research in Computational Linguistics) at the 
                    International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, 
                    where I'm enthusiastically exploring subjects like Data 
                    Structures, Algorithms, and Computational Linguistics.
